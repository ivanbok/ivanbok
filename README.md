Hello, I’m Ivan. Thank you for dropping by my GitHub page!

My key interests lie in Web Development, IT Architecting and Public Cloud Services. I'm currently working as a Solutions Architect at Microsoft, and I enjoy creating and building new things. Before Microsoft, I also worked as a Cloud Architect at AWS. 

On a personal level, I enjoy Astronomy and Astrophotography. 

If you'd like to connect with me, please add me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-bok/

Cheers!
